Hi, I’m Dileep Batta, a Computer Science student passionate about building impactful software solutions. I have hands-on experience in full-stack development using technologies like React, Flask, and Spring Boot, and I enjoy creating applications that combine strong UI/UX design with efficient backend systems.

I’m continuously improving my skills in DSA, problem-solving, and system design to prepare for Software Development Engineer roles. Alongside my academic journey, I’ve built projects such as fitness trackers, resume analyzers, and content dashboards, which demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and deploy production-ready applications.

Outside of coding, I’m driven by curiosity, teamwork, and the challenge of solving real-world problems through technology. My goal is to grow as versatile software engineer and contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.
